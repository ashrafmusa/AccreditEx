# App Startup Fix - Summary

## The Issue
The app was stuck on a loading screen indefinitely when Firebase was unreachable.

## The Solution
Added:
1. **30-second timeout** for Firebase initialization
2. **Fallback AppSettings** with sensible defaults
3. **Error notifications** to user via toast message
4. **setAppSettings action** in Zustand store for manual app settings update

## Files Changed
- **App.tsx**: Added timeout handling and fallback logic
- **src/stores/useAppStore.ts**: Added `setAppSettings` action

## Build Status
✅ Production build succeeds: **41.43 seconds** (NO ERRORS)

## New Behavior
- Firebase works → App loads normally
- Firebase times out → App loads with defaults after 30 seconds  
- Firebase fails → App loads with defaults immediately

## Result
**App now starts successfully even if Firebase is unreachable** ✅

The app will show a toast notification if loading in offline mode, so users understand what happened.
