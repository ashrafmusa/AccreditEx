# Settings Components Export Fix

## Problem
Browser error: `The requested module '/src/components/settings/SettingsCard.tsx' does not provide an export named 'SettingsCard'`

The barrel export file `src/components/settings/index.ts` was importing components as named exports, but the component files were only exporting as default exports.

## Root Cause
Mismatch between import and export patterns:
- **index.ts** (barrel file): `export { SettingsCard } from './SettingsCard'` (named export)
- **SettingsCard.tsx**: `export default SettingsCard` (default export only)

## Solution
Added named exports to all settings components while maintaining backward-compatible default exports:

```tsx
// Before
export default SettingsCard;

// After
export { SettingsCard };
export default SettingsCard;
```

## Files Fixed (7 components)

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| SettingsCard.tsx | ✅ Fixed |
| SettingsButton.tsx | ✅ Fixed |
| SettingsAlert.tsx | ✅ Fixed |
| SettingsLayout.tsx | ✅ Fixed |
| SettingsSection.tsx | ✅ Fixed |
| ToggleSwitch.tsx | ✅ Fixed |
| ColorPicker.tsx | ✅ Fixed |
| ImageUpload.tsx | ✅ Fixed |

## New Components (Already Had Named Exports)
These components were created with proper named exports from the start:
- SettingsPanel.tsx ✅
- FormGroup.tsx ✅
- AdvancedToggle.tsx ✅
- SettingsSearch.tsx ✅
- EnhancedInputs.tsx ✅
- SettingsPresets.tsx ✅

## Browser Errors Resolved
✅ Fixed: `The requested module does not provide an export named 'SettingsCard'`

The Tailwind CDN warning is separate and can be addressed in production deployment by using Tailwind CLI or PostCSS plugin configuration.

## Impact
- ✅ All settings components now export consistently
- ✅ Barrel export (index.ts) works correctly
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained with default exports
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing imports
- ✅ Full named export support for tree-shaking optimization

## Backward Compatibility
All existing default imports continue to work:
```tsx
// Still works (default import)
import SettingsCard from './SettingsCard';

// Now also works (named import)
import { SettingsCard } from './SettingsCard';

// And works with barrel export (named import)
import { SettingsCard } from './index';
```
